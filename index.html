<p>This project seeks to gather and analyze data in a way that empowers people to maximize their career prospects in a safe, free (as in "freedom") online environment. Currently in a "pre-beta" stage, The Reset is not yet configured as pure, free software. Suggestions for GNU-friendly implementations are welcome as The Reset will be pursuing a GNU Software License.</p>

<p>The Reset is currently seeking safe server options.</p>
