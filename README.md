The Reset
========

The Reset Database is an open source research project designed to make the recruiting process more efficient by questioning common myths.  The goal is to create a pipeline between qualified candidates from the hidden talent market and the practical small businesses whose recruiting resources do not have the reach of larger corporations. The first step is to identify that talent by finding out who's not getting interviews and why not.

This project seeks to gather and analyze data in a way that empowers people to maximize their career prospects in a safe, free (as in "freedom") online environment. Currently in a "pre-beta" stage, The Reset is not yet configured as pure, free software. Suggestions for GNU-friendly implementations are welcome as The Reset will be pursuing a GNU Software License.


Still a work-in-progress, the latest index page/homepage is at http://thereset.neocities.com. It is not yet connected to a database or storing information entered into the form. 

The Reset is currently seeking safe server options.
